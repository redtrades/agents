## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Happens | Fix |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| Forgetting `send_email` binding in wrangler config | Email Service uses a binding, not an API key | Add `"send_email": [{ "name": "EMAIL" }]` to wrangler.jsonc |
| Sending from an unverified domain | Domain must be onboarded onto Email Sending before first send | Run `wrangler email sending enable yourdomain.com` or onboard in Dashboard |
| Reading `message.raw` twice in email handler | The raw stream is single-use  -  second read returns empty | Buffer first: `const raw = await new Response(message.raw).arrayBuffer()` |
| Missing `text` field (HTML only) | Some email clients only show plain text; also helps spam scores | Always include both `html` and `text` versions |
| Using email for marketing/bulk sends | Email Service is for transactional email only | Use a dedicated marketing email platform for newsletters and campaigns |
| Forwarding to unverified destinations | `message.forward()` only works with verified addresses | Run `wrangler email routing addresses create user@gmail.com` or add in Dashboard |
| Testing with fake addresses | Bounces from non-existent addresses hurt sender reputation | Use real addresses you control during development |
| Hardcoding API tokens in source code | Tokens in code get committed and leaked | Use environment variables or Cloudflare secrets |
| Ignoring the `from` domain requirement | The `from` address must use a domain onboarded to Email Service | Verify the domain first, then send from `anything@that-domain.com` |
| Using `email` key in REST API `from` object | REST API uses `address` not `email` for `from` object | Use `{ "address": "...", "name": "..." }` for REST, `{ "email": "...", "name": "..." }` for Workers |
| Using `replyTo` in REST API | REST API uses snake_case field names | Use `reply_to` for REST API, `replyTo` for Workers binding |
